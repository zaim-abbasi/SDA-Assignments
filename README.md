## Assignment-1: Car Rental Management System (CRMS)

Welcome to the repository for the Software Design and Architecture course. In this assignment, I have designed and implemented a console-based Car Rental Management System (CRMS) for a car rental company. The system is expected to efficiently manage various types of cars, renters, and the rental transactions between them, demonstrating mastery of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

### How to Run
To run the program, execute the Main.java file.
